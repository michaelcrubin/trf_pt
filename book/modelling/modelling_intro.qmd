## Data Modelling {#sec-data-modelling .unnumbered}

::: {.callout-tip title="Summary"}
This chapter develops the theoretical framework for modeling highly uncertain, tail-heavy data using aggregated observations. We focus on extreme deviations in the tails and employ Monte Carlo simulations to build a coherent aggregated model.

Because our data is very scarce and concentrated in extremes, we face a dual challenge: (1) the **rare events** in the tail drive the largest damages but are also the most uncertain, and (2) we must build a model using only **aggregated observations**. Tail probabilities become especially unreliable when data is limited, so choosing appropriate distributional forms is critical.

To address these challenges, we propose a theoretical foundation that accounts for extreme tail behavior under aggregation. We will construct an **aggregated model**â€”one that can reproduce observed summaries and capture the unseen tail risk. Monte Carlo simulations play a central role: by generating many synthetic realizations under candidate distributions, we gain insight into how different assumptions affect tail estimates and overall risk.
