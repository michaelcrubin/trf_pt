## Why this matters {.unnumbered}

Agriculture is a vital economic sector in Portugal, yet many farms remain heavily underinsured. As climate change intensifies, extreme weather events pose ever-greater threats to crop yields and rural livelihoods. Farmers face rising uncertainty and high potential losses, making reliable protection more crucial than ever.

Despite the growing risks, there are currently few high-quality agricultural insurance products available in the market. Schweizer Hagel Portugal aims to fill this gap by leveraging its agronomic expertise, actuarial experience, and data‐science capabilities. Our mission is to strengthen the resilience of Portugal’s food production, ensuring farmers have access to insurance that truly safeguards them against climate‐driven losses.
