Having identified the performance limits of rainfall forecast models at the event level, the next step is to explore how these errors **propagate and transform** when used in downstream applications â€” particularly in **risk modelling**.

This chapter focuses on characterizing the **structure of forecast errors** with the goal of building **error-resilient models**. Instead of treating error as a residual nuisance, we study its **systematic components** and **aggregation behavior** to inform robust decision frameworks.

Key themes include:

- The effect of **temporal aggregation**: How averaging over hours, days, or months changes the magnitude and distribution of forecast error.
- Distinguishing between **bias and noise**: Separating persistent model drift from stochastic fluctuation.
- Detecting **long-term trends**: Identifying structural shifts in model performance across time.

These analyses allow us to simulate realistic scenarios, stress-test risk models, and better quantify uncertainty in operational use cases.

::: {.callout-tip title="Summary"}

This chapter transitions from performance diagnostics to **error modelling**:
- How do errors behave under time aggregation?
- Which part of the error is **systematic** vs **random**?
- How stable are model biases over space and time?

Understanding these questions is essential for transforming raw forecast outputs into **trustworthy probabilistic inputs** for applications in insurance, farming, and beyond.
