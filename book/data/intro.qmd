## Set-Up

The project is version-controlled via Git and hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com), enabling full transparency, reproducibility, and collaboration.\
It is structured as a modular Quarto project, with each component (data, methods, evaluation, visualization) contained in its own `.qmd` file.\
Code, documentation, and data are tightly integrated to allow automated re-runs and seamless updates.

## Publication

The complete documentation is published as a **GitHub Pages** website, accessible via a secret URL.\
There is no confidential or personal data included, allowing us to share the project openly with invited collaborators.\
The published site serves as the primary source for live results, plots, and interactive diagnostics.

## Data Storage

All input, intermediate, and output datasets are stored within the project directory under `DB/`.\
The folder structure is explained in detail in the file [data/structure.qmd](data/structure.qmd).\
Large datasets (e.g. model outputs, event metrics) are managed using **GitHub LFS (Large File Storage)** to ensure performance and trackability without bloating the main repository.

Data access is controlled via the repository permissions, and files are organized to match processing steps across scripts and visualizations.
