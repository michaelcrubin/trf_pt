## Theoretical Concept {#sec-energy-intro .unnumbered}

::: {.callout-tip title="Summary"}

This chapter introduces the core theoretical foundations needed to model highly uncertain data, with a focus on understanding tail risks and statistical structure before tarification can start.

Because our data is very scarce, we must be particularly careful in how we model it. Like in any statistical process, good modeling accounts not only for what we see, but also for the **unseen** data.

In this case, the unseen part is not just a small detail — it is the **majority** of the distribution. This makes the modeling challenge more extreme and more important to get right.

A special difficulty for weather risk modeling is the role of **tail probabilities**. These rare events often cause the largest damages, but are also the most uncertain. When data is limited, tail estimates become unreliable. Different distribution choces will make all the difference in the tails

This chapter is dedicated to building a strong **theoretical foundation**. We aim to understand the data’s behavior and risks before constructing the full model. This groundwork is essential for a relibale tarification.
