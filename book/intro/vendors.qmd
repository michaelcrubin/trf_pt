::: {.callout-tip title="Summary"}
We engaged six weather data providers to evaluate their suitability for our operational requirements. After technical meetings and discussions, we decided to proceed with three vendors for further integration and testing.
:::

\

## Meteomatics (MM)

Meteomatics is our current data provider. They offer:

- **High accessibility**: Simple and efficient API for data extraction.
- **Flexible pricing**: Adaptive pricing models depending on usage volume.
- **Innovative data sources**: Use of Meteodrones to collect upper-atmosphere data.

**Limitations**:

- **Transparency concerns**: There is some uncertainty around whether all models marketed as “non-calibrated” are truly uncalibrated.
- **Focus on data quality**: Less emphasis on scientific validation and reproducibility.

\

## Meteoblue

Meteoblue provides a more academic and model-focused offering:

- **Scientific orientation**: High emphasis on meteorological accuracy and method transparency.
- **Wide model base**: Access to over 40 weather models, including ensemble forecasts.

**Limitations**:

- **API complexity**: The offer and API structure are less intuitive and harder to integrate.
- **Flexibility**: Less accommodating in terms of custom access and pricing.

\

## MeteoSwiss

MeteoSwiss is the official national meteorological agency of Switzerland.

- **Planned inclusion**: Model data will become publicly accessible starting April 1, 2025.
- **Next steps**: Integration and evaluation will be reassessed once the API is available.

\

## Ubimet

Ubimet is an Austrian vendor with strong experience in Germany and the insurance sector.

- **Data quality focus**: High accuracy and reliable forecasts.
- **Insurance-ready**: Tailored offerings for the insurance industry.

**Limitations**:

- **Cost**: Estimated to be approximately three times more expensive than competitors.
- **Onboarding requirements**: NDA and commercial agreement required before testing.

\

## Meteotest

Meteotest is a Swiss provider known for customized solutions.

- **Customization**: Strong in bespoke development and quality control.
- **Niche offering**: Suitable for specific use cases but lacks scalability and broad productization.

\

## Jua AI

Jua is a Zurich-based startup claiming to develop the first AI-native weather model.

- **AI approach**: Based on a proprietary large-scale physics model.
- **Continental performance**: Promising results in continental Europe.

**Limitations**:

- **Alpine accuracy**: Performance in mountainous regions (e.g., Alps) is still limited.
- **Product maturity**: The offering is still in early stages, and some internal claims require further validation.
