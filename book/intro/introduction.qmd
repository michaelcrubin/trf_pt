## Introduction {#sec-energy-intro .unnumbered}

### Project Goal

The objective of this project is to close the protection gap in Portugal by developing a complete, data‐driven risk tariff system for Schweizer Hagel Portugal. We must produce a separate tariff for each combination of crop and municipality. Since there are 94 crops and 274 municipalities, this amounts to  **94 * 274 =25'756 distinct tariffs**.

### Data Basis

Our modeling relies on three main data sources:
- **Public damage data:** Annual losses reported for each crop–municipality pair.  
- **Weather data:** Historical meteorological observations relevant to agricultural risk.  
- **Single‐policy data:** Limited policy‐level information to help infer underlying risk at the field level.

These datasets are extremely scarce, as illustrated in Chapter “Data Inspection.” In particular, the public damage data are sparse, with many crop–municipality combinations having few or no reported losses over time.

### Aggregated Data

Unlike markets such as Switzerland—where policy‐level losses are available—in Portugal we only observe **aggregated** damage outcomes. In other words, we see the result of some unknown aggregation function applied to field‐level losses, rather than the field‐level losses themselves. This aggregation has important implications:
- The observed values do not directly represent our individual risk units (i.e., single fields or farms).  
- We must model how individual risks combine to produce the aggregated damage figures.  
- Careful attention to aggregation bias is crucial to obtain accurate tariffs.

### Careful Risk Modelling

Given the severe data limitations, short historical record, and rapidly growing exposure for Schweizer Hagel Portugal, it is critical to understand true underlying risks. In particular:
- **Few data:** Many crop–municipality pairs have zero or minimal loss records.  
- **Short history:** Only a limited number of years of observations are available.  
- **Growing exposure:** As Schweizer Hagel Portugal expands, exposure to risk multiplies, making small errors in estimation potentially very costly.

To address these challenges, we develop a robust theoretical model that serves as a foundation for tarification.

### Approach & Methodology

1. **Inspect the data:** Carefully examine the aggregated damage and policy data to identify patterns, gaps, and heteroskedasticity.  
2. **Understand data generation:** Determine how policy‐level losses and weather factors combine to produce the public aggregates.  
3. **Build a theoretical model:** Use domain expertise in agronomy and actuarial science to specify a plausible distributional form for policy‐level risk.  
4. **Simulate with Monte Carlo:** Run simulations under the theoretical model to study how aggregated data emerge from individual components.  
5. **Estimate dependence:** Leverage weather data to quantify dependence among fields in the same municipality.  
6. **Incorporate single‐policy insights:** Use available policy‐level data to infer the shape of the risk distribution at the atomic (field) level, rather than relying solely on aggregates.

...then using some model either bayesian or other

By combining these steps, we aim to produce reliable, data‐driven tariffs for all 25,756 crop–municipality combinations.
