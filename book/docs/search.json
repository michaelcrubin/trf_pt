    "text": "Why this matters\nAgriculture is a vital economic sector in Portugal, yet many farms remain heavily underinsured. As climate change intensifies, extreme weather events pose ever-greater threats to crop yields and rural livelihoods. Farmers face rising uncertainty and high potential losses, making reliable protection more crucial than ever.\nDespite the growing risks, there are currently few high-quality agricultural insurance products available in the market. Schweizer Hagel Portugal aims to fill this gap by leveraging its agronomic expertise, actuarial experience, and data‐science capabilities. Our mission is to strengthen the resilience of Portugal’s food production, ensuring farmers have access to insurance that truly safeguards them against climate‐driven losses.",

This includes assessing the overall distribution, slicing it into interpretable segments, and analyzing patterns across crops and years.\n\n\n\n\nFirst, we take a look at the raw data - specifically, the burn cost, defined as:\n\\[\nburn\\_cost = \\frac{tot\\_claims}{sum\\_insured}\n\\]\nThis inspection is done at the municipality–crop level, exactly as the data is received. The goal is to form an intuitive understanding of the distribution of the brun cost.\n\n\nOverall Burn Cost Distribution\nWe first visualize the burn cost across the entire dataset. The distribution is heavily zero-inflated, meaning there is a large number of observations with a burn cost of exactly \\(0\\). As this makes the visualization of the none-zero entries impossible, we create 4 different histogram-plots slicing different ranges of x. It’s like zooming in.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProbability by Slice\nThe table below summarizes how many observations fall into each of the defined burn cost segments.

    "text": "Summary\n\n\n\nWe investigate the spike at \\(x = 1\\) in the burn cost data. This section provides a theoretical explanation, supports it with empirical evidence, and concludes that this peak represents a natural upper bound — the burn ceiling — which should be explicitly modeled.\n\n\n\n\nThis section explores the peak at \\(x = 1\\) observed in the burn cost data. While much of the distribution appears continuous or decaying, this spike suggests a structural limit in how losses occur — specifically, a maximum possible burn of 1.\n\n\nTheoretical Concept\nIn typical natural processes, losses might follow a Gamma or Exponential distribution — both of which have a tail that extends to infinity. However, for crop losses, there is a hard ceiling at burn cost = 1.\nOnce a field is fully destroyed, no additional loss can occur — even if the damaging event (e.g. hail, drought) continues. In effect, all excess probability mass that would fall above \\(x = 1\\) must be accumulated at 1.\nThis leads to the formation of a spike at \\(x = 1\\), as shown in the conceptual model below:\n\n\n\n\nDoes the Probability Mass Match?\nExcluding the zero-inflated component, we observe that approximately 10%–20% of the empirical distribution’s probability mass lies at exactly \\(x = 1\\).\nWe can compare this to a Gamma distribution. For example:\n\nLet \\(X \\sim \\text{Gamma}(\\alpha = 1, \\theta = 0.3)\\)\n\nThen \\(\\mathbb{P}(X &gt; 1) \\approx 15\\%\\)\n\nThis matches quite intuitively. A Gamma with \\(\\theta = 0.3\\) is a reasonable approximation for crop-level burn rates, and this theoretical “overflow” mass aligns with the spike we observe at 1.\n\n\n\n\nHypothesis Testing\nIf this concept was true, then crop × municipality combinations with higher mean values would, in tendency, also have higher mass peaking at \\(x = 1\\). We can test this by grouping the data into crop × municipality combinations into such with P Mass at and such without the same phenomena. Then we simply take the mean of each group and compare them.\n\n\nShow Code\ntbl &lt;- data %&gt;%\n  dplyr::filter(burn_cost &gt; 0.15)%&gt;%\n  mutate(mass_above_1 = as.integer(burn_cost &gt;= 1)) %&gt;%\n  group_by(crop_key, municipality_name) %&gt;%\n  summarise(mass_above_1 = sum(mass_above_1),\n            has_above_1 = mass_above_1 &gt; 0,\n            n=n(),\n            mean_bc = mean(burn_cost), \n            .groups = \"drop\") %&gt;% \n  group_by(has_above_1) %&gt;%\n  summarise(mean_bc = mean(mean_bc), n=n(), .groups = \"drop\")\n\ntbl %&gt;%\n  flextable() %&gt;%\n  theme_vanilla()\n\n\nhas_above_1mean_bcnFALSE0.3280145328TRUE0.591642218\n\n\n\n\nResult\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPeak at \\(x = 1\\)\n\n\n\nThe crop × municipality combinations, which do not have any P Mass at \\(x = 1\\) have a mean value of 0.328, while the cells which do have P Mass at \\(x = 1\\) show a mean value of 0.592.

The likely explanation is aggregation dilution: when a single event affects a small part of a large area, the burn cost gets spread thinly over the full insured area. As we move from municipality to district to country, this effect should become more visible. The charts above suggest this pattern — especially for all crops combined — but it’s not entirely conclusive. We will test this hypothesis further in the next section.",

    "section": "",
    "text": "Summary\n\n\n\nWe investigate whether the large number of small—but nonzero—burn cost values can be explained by a dilution effect. In other words, small burn costs may result when actual losses are spread over very large insured amounts or large geographic areas.\n\n\nA substantial fraction of burn costs falls between 0 % and 1 %. Such tiny damages seem unlikely as individual claims—few policyholders would report losses that small in isolation. We therefore hypothesize a dilution effect, meaning that real damage exists but gets “diluted” when spread across large sums insured or extensive geographic areas.\nTo test this hypothesis, we use two proxies for aggregation scale:\n\nSum insured\nGeographic area\n\n\n\nDilution Effect on Sum Insured\nFirst, we visualize the raw relationship between burn cost and sum insured. The scatterplot shows that there is no obvious linear correlation—this is expected, since both variables exhibit strong heteroskedasticity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, we slice burn cost by quantiles of sum insured. In other words, we group policies into bins by sum insured and then compare the burn cost distributions within each bin. We choose five bins (quantiles at 20 %, 40 %, 60 %, 80 %, 100 %). We see that as the sum insured increases, the “center of mass” of the burn cost distribution shifts left—indicating smaller relative damages on larger policies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo display this more succinctly, we use box plots of burn cost across deciles of sum insured. These box plots confirm the trend: burn cost tends to be lower (and more tightly clustered near zero) in the higher-insured groups.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDilution Effect on Geographic Area\nNext, we examine whether a similar dilution effect occurs when damage is spread over larger geographic areas. We merge our burn dataset with municipality area information and then plot burn cost versus area. As before, the scatterplot alone does not reveal a clear trend, due to heteroskedasticity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe then slice burn cost by quantiles of geographic area (again using five bins). The histograms show a shift toward lower burn costs as area increases, but this effect is much weaker than what we observed for sum insured.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBox plots of burn cost by decile of area confirm the finding: there is only a slight tendency for burn cost to decrease as area grows. Overall, the dilution effect on area is negligible compared to the effect on sum insured.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResults\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBehavior of the Dilution Effect\n\n\n\nThere is a strong dilution effect with respect to sum insured, whereas the effect of geographic area is negligible or much weaker. We conclude that the clustering of burn cost values near zero primarily arises from dilution over large policy amounts, rather than being a natural effect. Now that we have established this dilution effect, we proceed to explore its statistical implications in the next chapter.",

    "text": "Atomic Risk Unit\nFirst, we define the practical unit we are modelling. We are interested in risks of crop losses from insurance policies. One unit of our risk is typically a single policy or field. Hence we define one atomic risk unit to be one insurance policy.\nNote that this is a quantity that does not appear explicitly in our data. We only see an aggregation thereof.\n\n\nTheoretical Risk Model\nWe defined that that our atomic risk unit follows a probability density function \\(f\\) with an unknown parameter \\(θ\\) and we selected the Gamma family for \\(f\\).\nWe face two options for our theoretical Risk Model:\n\nSingle-RV model – treat every policy × year outcome in a municipality as a draw from one common random variable \\(X\\) with a single scale \\(θ\\). Thus, the RV \\(X\\) would correspond to our observed data at municipality level.\nField-specific model – give each policy its own random variable \\(X_i\\); a year contributes one draw for \\(X_i\\). We then construct another RV \\(Y\\), which aggregates all \\(X_i\\) and corresponds to our observed data at municipality level.\n\nWhile Option 1 would be easier, it will mislead us for the following reasons:\n\nUsing a single \\(θ\\) across all risk units would introduce a systemic bias with high-risk fields being underpriced.\nJoining all policies and years into one RV would blow up n without giving much independent information and, thus, leads to false precision.\nDependence of policies not correctly modeled and potentially underestimates the tail-risks.\n\nConclusion: adopt option 2. Note that we are talking here about abstract policies/risk units, which we do not know from our data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRisk Model\n\n\n\nLet \\(X\\) be a policy-level burn rate: \\(X∼Gamma(α,θ)\\) with mean \\(E[X]\\) and variance \\(αθ^2\\). For a municipality containing \\(k\\) independent, identical policies in a given year, the average loss \\[\nY_t=\\frac{1}{k}\\sum_{i=1}^k X_{it}\n\\] is \\(Y∼Gamma(kα,θ/k)\\) with mean \\(αθ\\) and shrinking variance \\(αθ^2/k\\).\nWe observe \\(n\\) yearly values of \\(Y\\) and must estimate \\(α, θ\\).\n\n\n\n\nPractical Risk Model\nIn our real world, the policies \\(X_i\\) are not independent. In fact, they tend to be strongly dependent at least for the same perils. Intuitively, once it’s dry, most drought policies in the region are affected, but only few flooding policies.\nHence, we introduce the parameter \\(ρ\\in[0,1]\\) for dependence.\nIf \\(ρ=0\\), all policies are fully independent and we have \\(Y∼Gamma(kα,θ/k)\\) with mean \\(αθ\\) and variance \\(αθ^2/k\\).\nIf \\(ρ=1\\), all policies are fully dependent and we have \\(X_{1t}=X_{2t}=...=X_{kt}\\), hence \\(Y_{t} = X_{it}\\) with mean \\(αθ\\) and variance \\(αθ^2\\). We have only one RV.\nFor anything between \\([0,1]\\), we have Gamma mixtures.\n\n\nDependence & Information\nOne of the most important goals of this endavour is to gain information. We have small samples and potentially high tail risks. Hence, it’s important to squeeze out every bit of information.\nIf we have independent policies, the variance, which is the inverse of information, shrinks from \\(αθ^2\\) to \\(αθ^2/k\\), thus information \\(I\\) grows by the rate of \\(1\\sqrt{k}\\).\nIf we have a \\(ρ&gt;0\\) we have: \\[\nVar(Y)=αθ^2*(ρ+\\frac{1-ρ}{k})\n\\]\nThus the maximum information \\(I_{max} = 1/Var(Y)\\) erodes with dependence following \\((ρ+(1-ρ)/k)^{-1/2}\\)\nWe can simulate this for some settings:\n\n\nShow Code\nlibrary(here)\ninvisible(capture.output(source(here(\"scripts\", \"global.R\"))))\na &lt;- 1.5\nt &lt;- 0.3\nk &lt;- c(1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128)\nr &lt;- seq(0,1, by=0.01)\n\ndependent_var &lt;- function(a, t, k, r){\n  a*t^2*(r+(1-r)/k)\n}\n\nX &lt;- tidyr::expand_grid(a, t, k, r) %&gt;%\n  mutate(var = purrr::pmap_dbl(., .f=dependent_var)) %&gt;%\n  mutate(I_max = 1/var) %&gt;%\n  mutate(factor = (r+(1-r)/k)^(-1/2)) %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = r,color = factor(k), group = k)) +\n  geom_line( aes(y = factor), size = 1) +\n\n  labs(\n    x = \"ρ\",\n    y = \"I erosion factor\",\n    color = \"k (n policies)\",\n    title = \"Eroding Information I by dependence ρ\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 13)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDepencende erodes Information\n\n\n\nWe can say that as ~\\(ρ&gt;0.5\\), almost all additional information from large sample size has vanished and approaches the information of 1 sample. Mis-specifying \\(ρ=0\\) when it’s large would introduce a false precision.\nIn practical terms, this means that for a municipality with highly uniform risk exposure (e.g. mostly the same perils), we face a significant risk of underestimating the risk.

The steps are:\n\nGenerate samples: For each choice of \\(k\\) (number of fields) and scale \\(θ\\), draw \\(50000\\) independent samples of either \\(Exp(1/θ)\\) or \\(Gamma(α,θ)\\).\nSimulate it for different \\(k\\).\n\ncalculate the empirical parameters like SD and mean\n**Compare to theory: Visually compare the 2 curves, theory and empirical.\n\nOur goal is simply to verify that the simulated averages behave as expected under the Gamma aggregation model.\nNote we talk now about mean, not sum, hence theta gets divided by k\n\\[\\text{mean of } k * Gamma(α, θ)\\Longrightarrow Gamma(α*k, θ/k)\\]\n\n\nSimulation of Exp(1/θ)\nWe run it for 3 different θ:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy does empirical average diverge at small theta\nWe observe a strange behavour of the empirical average (blue). The problem is only the plotting function after_stat(density). Because it uses Gaussian Kerneling, the near-zero Gaussians leak to &lt;0 and hence distort the smoothing function. If you look at a hist of the empirical average, it looks perfectly gamma.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSimulation of Gamma(α, θ)\nIt is also thinkable that our atomic risk units (fields) follows a gamma distribution with some \\(α &gt; 1\\), in which case the most likely burn cost will be &gt;0. Thankfully, the aggregation behavour of k Gammas follows the exact same pattern as in the case of Exponentials.\nWe do it for 2 different θ and 2 different α:",

    "text": "Dependence is hard to model\n\n\n\nThe mean stays the same by linearity of Expectations.

Likely, the same perils in the municipality are strongly dependent, whereas different perils might be independent from each other. Hence, we have a \\(ρ\\) which is larger than 0 and smaller than 1. This changes the aggregation behaviour and makes the modelling more complicated.\n\n\nDependence Simulation with moment matching\nTo inject dependence we multiply every field in the same year by a common “weather” factor following \\(Gamma\\), whose variance is chosen so that the resulting pair-wise correlation equals the target \\(ρ\\). The theoretical comparisons then use a moment-matched Gamma whose variance is inflated by the factor \\(ρ+(1-ρ)/k\\), giving a simple analytic proxy for the correlated yearly average.\n\nDependencies with large n and k\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDependencies with large n and small k\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDependencies with small n and large k\nNote that we chose \\(n = 6\\) because at 2, the picture would be completly messy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDependencies with small n and small k",
